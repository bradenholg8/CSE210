2024-03-04,What was the strongest emotion I felt today?,I submitted an assignment for my Writing Class. I worked very hard on it and felt that it would get 100%. When it was graded, I received a 9.9/10. I felt very angry and think that my teacher refuses to give 100% on anything. She even said I did extrememly well on it.
